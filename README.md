# C Master
### 1. Info
This project is for personal education purposes.


### 2. Description
Things that are currently implemented:
 - Linked List
 - Stack, with:
  * push to start
  * push to end
  * remove element
  * search in stack
  * print stack
  * exit program
  
 - Round Buffer
 - Task 2 - Create linked list and then divide it into two lists depending if the value on the index is even or odd.
 - Task 3 - Implement doubly linked list, push values to it. If the list has this examplary values: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the list should be printed in this way: { 5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9 }
 - Task 6 - Check if every opening parentheses has its own closing parentheses. Provide index of opening and closing parentheses.
 - Doubly Linked List
 - Task 9 - Create a linked list, and divide the linked list on two separated list whether the value of the element is greater or lower than input number
 - Task 8 - Doubly linked list. When looping through (printing it out), it should print out every n-th element, and pop (remove) it out of the doubly linked list. This should be done until there are no more elements in the list.
 
TO DO List:
  - Classic pop function
